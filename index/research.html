              The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) is a 74-year-old
              international scientific and industrial computing society. Through
              its many Special Interest Groups, the ACM fosters research and
              communication in a broad range of computing areas. The society has
              around 100,000, spread over 174 countries leading to interaction
              between diversified computing enthusiasts. ACM provides us with
              one of the most enriching digital libraries which consists of
              various research papers. This leads us to availability of critical
              content being easily accessible. ACM strengthens the computing
              profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion
              of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence.
              ACM leads us to the pathway following which, in the near future,
              world’s biggest problems will be solved using computing.
