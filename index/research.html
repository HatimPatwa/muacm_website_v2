            “Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict and
            control the observed phenomenon.” Research is defined as careful
            consideration of study regarding a particular concern or problem
            using scientific methods.

              Good research follows a systematic approach to capture accurate
              data. Researchers need to practice ethics and a code of conduct
              while making observations or drawing conclusions.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 20px">
              The analysis is based on logical reasoning and involves both

              Burgeoning the research potential of Medi-Caps University is a
              primary goal behind this initiative. Having been ebullient in
              technology and student interaction, MUACM is now targeting to
              increase the research contribution of students at the University.
              Many students who are willing to perform research are somehow
              mired in clutches of academics or just don’t know where to start.
              We at MUACM are trying to act as an interface thereby connecting
              experts from the domains to these interested students and
              maintaining the zeal, enthusiasm, and flow of research at the
              University.

            Research would be based on technical domains such as Machine
            Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Information
            Security, IoT, etc. However, interested students from every domain
            are invited to take part in it. Research problems could be curated
            for sectors such as Agriculture, Medical, Finance, Drug Discovery,
            Advancements in Pandemic, Marketplace and customer personalization,
            etc. Note - While working on the research problems, more than one
            technical domain could be utilized and thus teams would be formed
            accordingly.

            </h3>
            <li style="padding: 20px">
              Beneficial for second and third-year students since they would get
              an in-depth understanding of research at the undergraduate level
              itself. Moreover, they would have ample time to learn, grow and
              research rather than rush up and ultimately submit papers just to
              add them to their resume. They would get a chance to showcase
              their work to a wide range of audiences thereby increasing name,
              fame, and experience.
            </li>
            <li style="padding: 20px">
              For the fourth-year students engaged in the In-house internships,
              this opportunity is a gem. They would work by precise deadlines,
              guidance from expert faculties belonging to a similar domain of
              interest, attending a variegated set of activities and workshops
              aimed towards grooming research. Research is a tedious task when
              done alone. However, in teams, it's a fun and joyous activity.

              Students aiming for higher studies like Master’s or Ph.D. can
              enter into teams to perform research, submit papers to esteemed
              publications, and ultimately grab a place in highly reputed
              universities worldwide.
